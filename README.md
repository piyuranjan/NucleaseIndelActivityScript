NucleaseIndelActivity
=====================

Automation for the quantification of indels arising due to nuclease activity

###Desired components for future:
* use a max thread option and update commands in BWA and FLASH, since they both use multiple threads.
* make a flag for all alignments (output) to be generated in SAM or BAM format.
