NucleaseIndelActivity
=====================

Automation for the quantification of indels arising due to nuclease activity

###Desired components for future:
* use a max thread option and update commands in BWA and FLASH, since they both use multiple threads.
* make an option for the user so that all alignments (output) could be generated in either SAM or BAM format.
